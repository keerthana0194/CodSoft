# CodSoft Internship - Java Programming Tasks
This repository contains all the tasks I completed during my CodSoft Java Development Internship.
Each task demonstrates practical implementation of Java programming concepts including logic building, object-oriented programming, file handling, and user interaction.
Throughout the internship, I gained hands-on experience in developing Java-based applications and explored how to build efficient, modular, and reusable code structures.

# Project Overview
1. Number Game: 
   A fun Java program where the user guesses a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.
   - Provides feedback (too high / too low / correct).
   - Limits number of attempts.
   - Option to play multiple rounds.
   - file: NumberGame.java
2. Student Grade Calculator: 
   A Java program that calculates total marks, average percentage, and assigns grades based on user input.
   - Accepts marks for multiple subjects.
   - Calculates total and average.
   - Determines grade based on performance.
   - file: GradeCalculator.java
3. ATM Interface: 
   A Java-based ATM simulation that performs basic banking operations.
   - Allows balance check, deposit, and withdrawal.
   - Validates sufficient balance before transactions.
   - Provides secure and user-friendly menu options.
   - file: ATM.java
4. Currency Converter:
   A Java program that converts one currency to another using fixed exchange rates.
   - Accepts user input for amount and currency type.
   - Performs real-time conversion based on preset values.
   - Displays converted amount clearly.
   - file: CurrencyConverter.java
5. Student Management System:
   A Java application to manage student records efficiently.
   - Adds, removes, searches, and displays student details.
   - Uses object-oriented programming concepts.
   - Simple console-based interface for easy use.
   - file: StudentManagement.java
